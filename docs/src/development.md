# Development

Clone Martin, setting remote name to `upstream`. This way `main` branch will be updated automatically with the latest changes from the upstream repo.

```shell, ignore
git clone https://github.com/maplibre/martin.git -o upstream
cd martin
```

Fork Martin repo into your own GitHub account, and add your fork as a remote

```shell, ignore
git remote add origin  _URL_OF_YOUR_FORK_
```

Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), and [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/):

```shell, ignore
# For Ubuntu-based distros
sudo apt install -y  docker.io  docker-compose  libssl-dev  build-essential  jq pkg-config
```

Install [Just](https://github.com/casey/just#readme) (improved makefile processor). Note that some Linux and Homebrew distros have outdated versions of Just, so you should install it from source:

```shell, ignore
cargo install just
```

When developing MBTiles SQL code, you may need to use `just prepare-sqlite` whenever SQL queries are modified. Run `just` to see all available commands:

```shell, ignore
